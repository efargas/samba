                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.1.6
                           March 11, 2014
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address
CVE-2013-4496 (Password lockout not enforced for SAMR password changes) and
CVE-2013-6442 (smbcacls can remove a file or directory ACL by mistake).

o  CVE-2013-4496:
   Samba versions 3.4.0 and above allow the administrator to implement
   locking out Samba accounts after a number of bad password attempts.

   However, all released versions of Samba did not implement this check for
   password changes, such as are available over multiple SAMR and RAP
   interfaces, allowing password guessing attacks.

o  CVE-2013-6442:
   Samba versions 4.0.0 and above have a flaw in the smbcacls command. If
   smbcacls is used with the "-C|--chown name" or "-G|--chgrp name"
   command options it will remove the existing ACL on the object being
   modified, leaving the file or directory unprotected.


Changes since 4.1.5:
--------------------

o   Jeremy Allison <jra@samba.org>
    * BUG 10327: CVE-2013-6442: ensure we don't lose an existing ACL when
      setting owner or group owner.


o   Andrew Bartlett <abartlet@samba.org>
    * BUG 10245: CVE-2013-4496: Enforce password lockout for SAMR password
      changes.


o   Stefan Metzmacher <metze@samba.org>
    * BUG 10245: CVE-2013-4496: Enforce password lockout for SAMR password
      changes.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.1.3
                         December 9, 2013
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address
CVE-2013-4408 (DCE-RPC fragment length field is incorrectly checked) and
CVE-2012-6150 (pam_winbind login without require_membership_of restrictions).

o  CVE-2013-4408:
   Samba versions 3.4.0 and above (versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.17, 3.5.0 -
   3.5.22, 3.6.0 - 3.6.21, 4.0.0 - 4.0.12 and including 4.1.2) are
   vulnerable to buffer overrun exploits in the client processing of
   DCE-RPC packets. This is due to incorrect checking of the DCE-RPC
   fragment length in the client code.

   This is a critical vulnerability as the DCE-RPC client code is part of
   the winbindd authentication and identity mapping daemon, which is
   commonly configured as part of many server installations (when joined
   to an Active Directory Domain). A malicious Active Directory Domain
   Controller or man-in-the-middle attacker impersonating an Active
   Directory Domain Controller could achieve root-level access by
   compromising the winbindd process.

   Samba server versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.17 and versions 3.5.0 - 3.5.22 are
   also vulnerable to a denial of service attack (server crash) due to a
   similar error in the server code of those versions.

   Samba server versions 3.6.0 and above (including all 3.6.x versions,
   all 4.0.x versions and 4.1.x) are not vulnerable to this problem.

   In addition range checks were missing on arguments returned from calls
   to the DCE-RPC functions LookupSids (lsa and samr), LookupNames (lsa and samr)
   and LookupRids (samr) which could also cause similar problems.

   As this was found during an internal audit of the Samba code there are
   no currently known exploits for this problem (as of December 9th 2013).

o  CVE-2012-6150:
   Winbind allows for the further restriction of authenticated PAM logins using
   the require_membership_of parameter. System administrators may specify a list
   of SIDs or groups for which an authenticated user must be a member of. If an
   authenticated user does not belong to any of the entries, then login should
   fail. Invalid group name entries are ignored.

   Samba versions 3.3.10, 3.4.3, 3.5.0 and later incorrectly allow login from
   authenticated users if the require_membership_of parameter specifies only
   invalid group names.

   This is a vulnerability with low impact. All require_membership_of group
   names must be invalid for this bug to be encountered.


Changes since 4.1.2:
--------------------

o   Jeremy Allison <jra@samba.org>
    * BUG 10185: CVE-2013-4408: Correctly check DCE-RPC fragment length field.


o   Stefan Metzmacher <metze@samba.org>
    * BUG 10185: CVE-2013-4408: Correctly check DCE-RPC fragment length field.


o   Noel Power <noel.power@suse.com>
    * BUGs 10300, 10306: CVE-2012-6150: Fail authentication if user isn't
      member of *any* require_membership_of specified groups.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.1.1
                         November 11, 2013
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address
CVE-2013-4475 (ACLs are not checked on opening an alternate
data stream on a file or directory) and
CVE-2013-4476 (Private key in key.pem world readable).

o  CVE-2013-4475:
   Samba versions 3.2.0 and above (all versions of 3.2.x, 3.3.x,
   3.4.x, 3.5.x, 3.6.x, 4.0.x and 4.1.x) do not check the underlying
   file or directory ACL when opening an alternate data stream.

   According to the SMB1 and SMB2+ protocols the ACL on an underlying
   file or directory should control what access is allowed to alternate
   data streams that are associated with the file or directory.

   By default no version of Samba supports alternate data streams
   on files or directories.

   Samba can be configured to support alternate data streams by loading
   either one of two virtual file system modues (VFS) vfs_streams_depot or
   vfs_streams_xattr supplied with Samba, so this bug only affects Samba
   servers configured this way.

   To determine if your server is vulnerable, check for the strings
   "streams_depot" or "streams_xattr" inside your smb.conf configuration
   file.

o  CVE-2013-4476:
   In setups which provide ldap(s) and/or https services, the private
   key for SSL/TLS encryption might be world readable. This typically
   happens in active directory domain controller setups.


Changes since 4.1.0:
--------------------

o   Jeremy Allison <jra@samba.org>
    * BUGs 10234 + 10229: CVE-2013-4475: Fix access check verification on stream
      files.


o   BjÃ¶rn Baumbach <bb@sernet.de>
    * BUG 10234: CVE-2013-4476: Private key in key.pem world readable.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.1.0
                         October 11, 2013
                   =============================


This is is the first stable release of Samba 4.1.

Samba 4.1 will be the next version of the Samba suite and includes
all the technology found in both the Samba4 series and the stable 3.x
series. The primary additional features over Samba 3.6 are
support for the Active Directory logon protocols used by Windows 2000
and above.

Major enhancements in Samba 4.1.0 include:

Client tools support SMB2/3
===========================

Samba 4.1.0 contains the first release of our client tools
and client library that work over the new protocols SMB2 or SMB3.
Note that SMB3 only works either to a Samba server version 4.0.0
or above, or to a Windows Server running Windows 2012 or Windows 8.

The default protocol for smbclient and smbcacls is still
SMB1 (the NT1 protocol dialect). An SMB2 or SMB3 connection
can be selected in one of two ways. The easiest way to test
the new protocol connection is to add the -mMAX_PROTOCOL
command line switch to either smbclient or smbcacls.

For example, to connect using SMB3 with smbclient a user
would type:

smbclient //server/share -Uuser%password -mSMB3

Another example of connecting using SMB2 using smbcacls
would be:

smbcacls //server/share -Uuser%password -mSMB2 filename

Note that when connecting using SMB2 or SMB3 protocols
the UNIX extensions are no longer available inside the
smbclient command set. This is due to UNIX extensions
not yet being defined for the SMB2 or SMB3 protocols.

The second way to select SMB2 or SMB3 connections is to
set the "client max protocol" parameter in the [global]
section of your smb.conf.

Setting this parameter will cause all client connections
from Samba and its client tools to offer the requested
max protocol to a server on every connection request.

For example, to cause all client tools (including winbindd,
rpcclient, and the libsmbclient library) to attempt use SMB3
by default add the line:

client max protocol = SMB3

to the [global] section of your smb.conf. This has not
been as widely tested as the -mPROTOCOL options, but
is intended to work correctly in the final release of
4.1.0.

Encrypted transport
===================

Although Samba servers have supported encrypted transport
connections using the UNIX extensions for many years,
selecting SMB3 transport allows encrypted transport
connections to Windows servers that support SMB3, as
well as Samba servers.

In order to enable this, add the "-e" option to the
smbclient command line.

For example, to connect to a Windows 2012 server over
SMB3 and select an encrypted transport you would use
the following command line:

smbclient //Win2012Server/share -Uuser%password -mSMB3 -e


Directory database replication (AD DC mode)
===========================================

Directory replication has been reworked in order to improve the
correctness and efficiency.
As a net effect of it, replication with other domain controllers with
a heavily modified schema is now possible (ie. Windows 2012 DCs or
other Windows DC with exchange installed) and replication didn't fail
anymore in such environments.


Server-Side Copy Support
========================

Samba 4.1.0 adds support for server-side copy operations via the SMB2
FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK request. Clients making use of server-side copy
support, such as Windows Server 2012, should experience considerable
performance improvements for file copy operations, as file data need not
traverse the network.
This feature is enabled by default on the smbd file server.


Btrfs Filesystem Integration
============================

The Btrfs VFS module provided with Samba 4.1.0 further improves the
performance of server-side copy operations on shares backed by a Btrfs
filesystem. It does so by allowing multiple files to share the same
on-disk extents, avoiding the unnecessary duplication of source and
destination file data during a server-side copy operation.

This feature can be explicitly enabled on smbd shares backed by a Btrfs
filesystem with the smb.conf parameter:
vfs objects = btrfs


REMOVED COMPONENTS
==================

The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) has been removed.
Details why SWAT has been removed can be found on the samba-technical mailing
list:
